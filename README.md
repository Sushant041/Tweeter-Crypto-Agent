Tweeter Crypto Agent

Tweeter Crypto Agent is an AI-powered crypto trading bot that reacts to live Twitter sentiment. It scrapes tweets about cryptocurrencies, analyzes their sentiment in real-time, and automatically executes buy/sell trades on the Sepolia Ethereum testnet using Uniswap smart contracts.

Overview

In volatile crypto markets, public sentiment — especially on platforms like Twitter — can trigger major price swings. This project turns social chatter into actionable trading signals using:





Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect sentiment (positive/negative).



Automated trading logic to make buy/sell decisions.



Smart contract interactions to execute trades on-chain.

This demonstrates how AI and Web3 can work together to create intelligent, autonomous financial agents.
